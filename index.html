	<p>I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the <a href= "https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/" >Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics (ITWM) </a> and the <a href="https://www.scicomp.uni-kl.de/ " > Scientific Computing Group (SciComp)</a> of the University of Kaiserslautern. I am supervised by Nicolas Gauger (SciComp), Janis Keuper (ITWM) and work together with Philip Stier and the Climate Processes group at the University of Oxford. My interest key research interests are the robustness of Deep Learning methods and how Machine Learning can be used to improve climate models. <p>
    <p> I received a masters degree in mathematics with a specialization in numerical analysis from University of Tübingen, where I also got an education in machine learning.

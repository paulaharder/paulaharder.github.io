I am an incoming postdoctoral fellow at Mila Quebec AI Institute and McGill University. I am working on improving deep learning models to be useful in weather and climate modeling, this includes post-processing, emulation and physics-constrained approaches. 

Previously I did my PhD research at the Fraunhofer Institute (ITWM) and the computer science department of TU Kaiserslautern in collaboration with the University of Oxford.

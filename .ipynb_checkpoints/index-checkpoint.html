	<p>Hi, welcome to my website. I'm Paula Harder, currently a visiting researcher at the University of Oxford working on aerosol model emulation with Philip Stier and Duncan Watson-Parris and also an intern with David Rolnick at Mila, working on Physics-Constrained Climate Downscaling. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href= "https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/de/abteilungen/hpc/mitarbeiter/paula-harder.html" >Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics (ITWM) </a> and the <a href="https://www.scicomp.uni-kl.de/ " > Scientific Computing Group (SciComp)</a> of the University of Kaiserslautern. I am supervised by Nicolas Gauger (SciComp) and Janis Keuper (ITWM). Mey key research interest is Deep Learning applications for Climate and Weather Modeling. Besides that, I worked on robustness in Deep Learning on the topic of Adversarial Attacks and am interested in any applications of ML to climate, earth, and, space science, as well as in the broad field of AI for Social Good. I am involved with the NASA/ESA Frontier Development Lab, where I worked as an ML Scientist and will return as a team lead for this summer, looking into aerosols from wildfires. <p>
    <p>I received a master's degree in Mathematics with a specialization in Numerical Analysis from the University of Tübingen, where I also got an education in Machine Learning. During my master's I did research projects at the German Climate Computation Center and a company for simulation of electrical networks in my spare time. After graduating I worked as a Development Engineer in the automotive industry, both on software development projects as well as data science applications. When I am not working on research projects I enjoy doing hackathons and rock climbing.

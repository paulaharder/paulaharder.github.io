	<p>I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the <a href= "https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/" >Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics (ITWM) </a> and the <a href="https://www.scicomp.uni-kl.de/ " > Scientific Computing Group (SciComp) of the University of Kaiserslautern </a>. I am supervised by Nicolas Gauger (SciComp), Janis Keuper (ITWM) and work together with Philip Stier and the Climate Processes group at the University of Oxford. My interest is Machine Learning, especially applied to Climate Science. <p>
    <p> I received a masters degree in mathematics with a spezialisation in numerical analysis from University of TÃ¼bingen, where I also received an education in machine learning. <a href="/about">Read more about me.</a></p>

#### Brief academic bio
I am a researcher at Mila Quebec AI Institute in Montreal/Canada working with David Rolnick. Additionally, I am an incoming postdoctoral fellow at McGill university and Mila. My Ph.D in Machine Learning/Computer Science was done at the Fraunhofer ITWM and University of Kaiserlautern in collaboration with the University of Oxford supervised by Janis Keuper, Nicolas Gauger and Philip Stier. During my Ph.D I interned at NASA/ESA Frontier Development Lab (FDL), Mila and the Allen Institute for AI. Prior to that I worked as a developer and data scientist in the automotive industry after obtaining my masters in Mathematics from the University of Tuebingen, where I specialized in numerical analysis, supervised by Christian Lubich.

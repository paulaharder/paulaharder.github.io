#### Brief academic bio
I am a researcher at Mila Quebec AI Institute in Montreal/Canada working with David Rolnick. Additionally, I am a PhD candidate in Machine Learning/Computer Science at the Fraunhofer ITWM and University of Kaiserlautern. My PhD research was on deep learning for climate modeling in collaboration with the University of Oxford and supervised by Janis Keuper, Nicolas Gauger and Philip Stier. During my PhD I interned at NASA/ESA Frontier Development Lab (FDL), Mila and the Allen Institute for AI. Prior to that I worked as a developer and data scientist in the automotive industry after obtaining my masters in Mathematics from the University of Tuebingen, where I specialized in numerical analysis, supervised by Christian Lubich.

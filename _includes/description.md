Pronouns: She/Her

### Brief Academic Bio
I am a ML Scientist at ECMWF, working on atmospheric composition forecasting. Previously, I was a postoctoral researcher at the Mila Quebec AI Institute in Montreal, Canada, where I worked with David Rolnick on generative models for downscaling. I hold a PhD in Machine Learning and Computer Science from Fraunhofer ITWM and the University of Kaiserslautern. My doctoral research, conducted in collaboration with the University of Oxford, focused on deep learning for accelerating climate modeling, supervised by Janis Keuper, Nicolas Gauger, and Philip Stier. 

Throughout my PhD, I have had the opportunity to intern at NASA/ESA Frontier Development Lab (FDL), Mila, and the Allen Institute for AI. Before, I worked as a developer and data scientist in the automotive industry after earning a master’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Tübingen, with a specialization in numerical analysis under the supervision of Christian Lubich.

### Current Projects
My current work focuses on large scale models for forecasting of air quality, aerosols and gases. Besides, I am interested in deep learning applications for meteorological downscaling. 

### Broader Research Interests
I am passionate about advancing machine learning to address important challenges in environmental, climate, and weather modeling. My research focuses on issues such as ensuring physical consistency, improving generalization under distribution shifts, and better capturing extreme events in data.
